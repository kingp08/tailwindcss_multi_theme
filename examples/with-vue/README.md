# With Vue

This example uses Vue (created with `vue-cli`), and has the ability to toggle between themes, apart from showing a page with a nested section with dark theme. It shows you can use not only entire themed pages, but also themed sections, inside other themed sections!

Another feature of this example is that it detects automatically the user's preferred theme.
