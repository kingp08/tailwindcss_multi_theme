# Simple example

This example shows a page with a nested section with dark theme. It shows you can use not only entire themed pages, but also themed sections, inside other themed sections!

You can test applying the `.theme-dark` class to the `body` tag to see everything become darker. Or just remove the class from the element it's now to apply the default theme.

### Test it

Clone the repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/estevanmaito/tailwindcss-multi-theme.git
```

Enter the project folder and execute it:

```sh
cd tailwindcss-multi-theme/examples/simple
npm install
npm run tailwind
```

Now you can just open `index.html` in the browser.
